# SepiaFilter-CPP
University second year project. A desktop application that turns a color image into a sepia-colored image with usage of one of two DLLs - first in C++, second in ASM with vector instructions.
After launch you can load .bmp file (it will be shown in the app), choose threads number from 1 to 64 (when program starts it automatically detects processor threads number and sets it) and choose the DLL.
When you start it, the loaded image is changed into sepia-color (the result is shown in the app), execution time is measured and you can save the new image to .bmp file.
